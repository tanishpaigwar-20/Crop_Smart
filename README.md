# Crop_Smart
Crop_Smart is a  Machine Learning-based Crop Recommendation System that analyzes soil parameters (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, pH, humidity, and temperature) to suggest the most suitable crops for cultivation. The system leverages data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification algorithms to provide accurate recommendations.
